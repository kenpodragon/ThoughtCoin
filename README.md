# ThoughtCoin
OpenSource repository for development of the ThoughtCoin distributed AI platform.


The AI Future is Distributed, the AI Future is ThoughtChain
The surge in AI's popularity and demand is outpacing the growth of dedicated hardware. While companies are rushing to create systems on chips (SOC) and Neural Processing Units (NPUs) to breakthrough this barrier, it still requires unscalable hardware growth.

Introducing ThoughtChain
ThoughtChain aims to harness the untapped computational power of distributed devices to provide cost-effective and accessible AI processing for everyone, today, as opposed to years from now. What Edison did for power, TC will do for AI.

How ThoughtChain Works
😀 User Participation: Users install the ThoughtChain client. Their devices perform background AI computations, earning them ThoughtCoins. When users need more intensive AI processing (complex image generation, advanced text analysis, etc.), they expend ThoughtCoins. (Think block chain hashing)
😎 Developer Incentive: Developers build and upload AI models (LLMs or others) to the ThoughtChain network. These models are encrypted for protection, but decentralized distributed. Developers earn ThoughtCoins whenever their models are utilized, fostering continuous innovation.
🤠 Established Players: Large AI companies integrate with ThoughtChain. They can generate ThoughtCoins on their own hardware with their own results, plus additional revenue via leveraging their own models on the platform.
🤑 Open Market: ThoughtCoin exchanges ensure fluidity. Users can purchase more ThoughtCoins for bursts of AI activity or store them for later use.

Key Benefits
🏧 Reduced AI Costs: Users avoid costly hardware upgrades, paying only for AI access when needed.
☢ Decentralized Power: Breaks the reliance on a few large AI providers, democratizing access to powerful processing.
🚻 Scalability: The Thought chain network expands organically as more users and developers join.
📵 Developer Opportunity: A new revenue stream for model creators, incentivizing the development of specialized AI tools.

Challenges to Overcome
🚔 Security: Robust encryption and security ensure user data privacy and model integrity.
✈ Latency: ThoughtChain must strive for low-latency processing to compete with dedicated hardware.
🎢 Model Quality: A curation system will be needed to maintain model standards and prevent misuse.
☃ Market Adoption: Gaining critical mass of users and developers is essential for ThoughtChain's success.


ThoughtChain isn't just an idea; it's poised to redefine how AI is developed, accessed, and utilized. By decentralizing AI power, we create a future where:
😈 Businesses of all sizes harness the full potential of AI without infrastructure barriers.
😱 Innovators and developers directly profit from their creations, fueling further advancement.
🎅 Everyday users participate in a groundbreaking AI ecosystem.

This is a unique opportunity to join in the democratization of a transformative technology. Become a part of the ThoughtChain revolution and shape the future of AI.


Modules:
1) Distributed processing unit (DPU) - framework to split and share AI model generation across local CPU/GPU and remote networking.
2) Individual user client - framework to allow users to share local resources for processing DPU packages.
3) ThoughtCoin hashing algorithm - tied into the processing signatures generated by the DPU to provide generated hashed coins. (Built from Etherium)
4) Model Management - framework to create, encrypt, distribute, and track usage of developed models (with security forensics to prevent duplication - first to network claims the fingerprint)
